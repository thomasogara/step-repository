    <h2>How I built this portfolio website</h2>
    <h3>Technology Used</h3>
    <p>
      This portfolio website was written using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript
      (version ES6+). There are no external dependencies in the backend or
      front-end software.
    </p>
    <h3>Data Management</h3>
    <p>
      For persistent data storage, I used a JSON file hosted
      on the server, and fetched it using the ES6+
      <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API">
      fetch()</a> function. Since the persistent storage requirements of
      the site are read-only from a user perspective, this is the ideal
      solution; it does not mandate that a database management system would run
      on the server at all times, which is costly. Running a DBMS also
      introduces a potential point of failure for the site's backend.
      Using a JSON file to store persistent data also reduces the number of
      dependencies on the front-end software, as parsing JSON data in ES6+
      JavaScript is a native feature, and does not require the use of any
      third-party libraries.
